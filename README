====ABOUT====
This program fetches data for all the restaurant week restaurants and then presents that information so it's easy for peopel to find good restaurants to go to. Currently, sorting by distance or rating (to my knowledge) is not available in other applications. Hopefully, this app will make it easy to find good restaurants to go to.  

Note that this dynamically fetches restuarant links to yelp and opentable. It's possible that this fetches an incorrect link because Yelp's search engine isn't great. It takes a long time to scrape all Yelp's data since they rate limit you and they're slow to respond to applications for a higher rate limit, so, though I have an idea for a better scraping algorithm (see TODO), this will have to wait till the summer 11 restaurant week.

===HOW TO GET STARTED===
1) Install Google App Engine. Their Getting Started tutorial is thorough, so follow that if you're lost.
2) Initialize this git repo somewere. 
3) From the google_appengine directory, run ./dev_appserver.py path/to/git/repo.
4) Check results on localhost:8080

Again, detailed instructions are on Google's website.

The commenting on the files is a little sparse, but I think most of the function/var names are self-documenting, especially if you have some familiarity with Python/App Engine.

===TODO===
These features will be done for the next restaurant week since I'm busy right now, but, if you're interested in implementhing this features, feel free to let me know and I can give you access.

Wishlist:
  -change tablesorter parser so distances are sorted by double value and not lexographically, so that 2 miles < 13 miles
  -on location change, re-sort table based on current user criteria
  -make table scrollable and fit within page, so user doesn't need to scroll down to view the table. That way, the user doesn't need to scroll back up to change search criteria.
  -select restaurants to compare/hide?
  -show travel time using subway since this often doesn't correspond to distance
  -save state so users can bookmark pages
  -automatically detect location instead of setting columbia as default; this would be especially useful for mobile users
  -change Yelp search algorithm to make sure the address of the result matches the address from the OpenTable page.

====DATABASE STUFF====
Moses scraped some data from opentable to get a list of all the restaurants participating and the days on which they are participating. Here's how to access that info:

Date stored in MongoHQ
username: admin
password: sekret
collection name: restaurants
database: RWeek
server: Flame
port: 27041

if you want to access from the console:
mongo flame.mongohq.com:27041/RWeek -u <user> -p<password>

if you want to set up a read-only acct, email me @ nnythm@gmail.com, my github acct is mnn2104

====CONTRIBUTORS====
I, Sid Nair, wrote most of the app. Moses Nakamura helped with scraping the list of restaurants from OpenTable.

Some awesome jQuery plugins that saved me a lot of time:
